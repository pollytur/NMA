Repo for NeuroMatch Academy  project on HCP dataset

The scripts includes code written by Polly and Sunreeta to load and analyse the Human Connectome project dataset made available by Neuromatch academy for the summer school 2020.  

The objective was to analyse functional and effective connectivity across brain regions in different tasks by means of graph analysis of the correlation and granger causality matrices.

Brief results maybe found here ([slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAEDbi0SMms/BmvDK8jL76An1mSDy8HPcg/view?utm_content=DAEDbi0SMms&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=sharebutton) and video) or inside notebooks. Graphs folder contains some graph representation of functional networks for different tasks.
